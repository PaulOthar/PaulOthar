# Hello 😄, im Paul
Im a software developer interested in low level and cybersecurity.<br>
I've been working on my own engine for the past years, acquiring skills relevant for optimization and efficient computer resources management.<br>
As a side hobby (since programming is both my job and my hobby), i am planning to build my own MSX clone, with old hardware, such as the Z80 procesor (DIP).

# Personal Experiences:
For now, i have reached a desirable checkmark on a couple of projects:
