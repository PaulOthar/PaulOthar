# Hello 😄, im Paul
Im a Newbie Programmer, widly interested in Low Level Systems (Although i might use Hight Level Languages to Build Prototypes).

Personally im a big fan of tabletop RPG's, and most of my projects were built to serve as a tool for those that are also interested in messing around with tabletop games in general.

But My interest is not exclusive to game development, since other (probably hidden) projects are focused in dealing with data analisys and AI. But the lack of usage does not allow me to finish a version that satisfies my ego.

Currently im very interested in cyber security, but nowhere near confident to actually practice it.

# Experiences

### Disclaimer:
Although some of my current 'finished' projects were made in Javascript, im focused in developing the logic above all else, instead of adapting the language to fit my needs, since the Language may vary, but the Logic never will.

# Known Languages and level of "Knowledge"
|Language|Knowledge|Interest|
|-|-|-|
|Java|Intermediate|High|
|Javascript|Intermediate|Low|
|C/C++|Low|Intermediate|
|Python|Low|Low|

And im also interested in learning Assembly, but i believe it would be a very painful experience to be had this early in my programming 'career'.

### Why Othar?
Othar is just a nickname that i think is cool. it means "Foolish Warrior" in some forgotten game universe (I dont remember where i got it from 😢)

### For How Much Would You use Light Theme?
There is no amounts of money in this world that would bribe me into torture my eyes with the sight of burning agony.
